    "# NLP Lab, Part I\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first lab of 6.S191!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Administrivia\n",
    "Things to install:\n",
    "- [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/os_setup)\n",
    "- [word2vec](https://github.com/danielfrg/word2vec)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lab Objectives:\n",
    "-  Learn Machine Learning methodology basics (train/dev/test sets)\n",
    "-  Learn some Natural Language Processing basics (word embeddings with word2vec) \n",
    "-  Learn the basics of tensorflow, build your first deep neural nets (MLP, RNN) and get results!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And we'll be doing all of this in te context of Twitter sentiment analysis. Given a tweet like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "omg 6.S196 is so cool #deeplearning #mit\n",
    "```\n",
    "We want an algorithm to label this tweet as positive or negative. It's intractable to try to solve this task via some lexical rules, so instead, we're going to use deep learning to embed these tweets into some deep latent space where distinguishing between the two is realtively simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Machine Learning Basics\n",
    "Given some dataset with tweets $X$, and sentiments $Y$, we want to learn a function $f$, such that $Y = f(X)$.\n",
    "In our context, $f$ is deep neural network parameterized by some network weights $\\Theta$, and  we're going to do our learning via gradient descent. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective Function\n",
    "To start, we need someway to measure how good our $f$ is, so we can take a gradient in respective to that performance and move in the right direction. We call this performance evaluation our Loss function, L , and this is something we want to minimize. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are doing classification (pos vs neg), a common loss function  to use is cross entropy.\n",
    "$$L( \\Theta ) = - \\Sigma_i ( f(x_i)*log(y_i) + (1-f(x_i))log(1-y_i) ) $$ where $f(x)$ is the probablity a tweet $x$ is positive, which we want to be 1 given it's postive and 0 given that it's negative and $y$ is the correct answer. We can access this function with `tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits`, which will come handy in code. Given that $f$ is parameterized by $\\Theta$, we can take the gradient $\\frac{dL}{d\\Theta}$, and we learn by updating our parameters to minimize the loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this loss is 0 if the prediction is correct and very large if we predict something has 0 probablity of being positive when it is positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "To measure how well we're doing, we can't just look at how well our model performs on it's training data. It could be just memorizing the training data and perform terribly on data it hasn't seen before. To really measure how $f$ performs in the wild, we need to present it with unseen data, and we can tune our hyper-parameters (like learning rate, num layers etc.) over this first unseen set, which we call our development (or validation) set. However, given that we optimized our hyper-parameters to the development set, to get a true fair assesment of the model, we test it in respect to a held-out test set at the end, and generaly report those numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary:\n",
    "Namely, we training on one set, i.e. a training set,\n",
    "evaluate and tune our hyper paremeters in regards to our performance on the dev set,\n",
    "and report finals results on a completely heldout test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's load these now, this ratio of sizes if fairly standard.\n",

    "## NLP Basics\n",
    "The first question we need to address is how do we represent a tweet? how do we represent a word?\n",
    "One way to do this is with one_hot vectors for each word. Where a given word $w_i= [0,0,...,1,..0]$.\n",
    "However, in this representation, words like \"love\" and \"adore\" are as similar as \"love\" and \"hate\", because the cosine similarity is 0 in both cases. Another issue is that these vectors are huge in order to represent the whole vocab. To get around this issue the NLP community developed a techique called Word Embeddings. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Word2Vec\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is we represent a word with a vector $\\phi$ by the context the word  appears in. By training a neural network to predict the context of words across a large training set, we can use the weights of that neural networks to get a dense, and useful representation that captures context. Word Embeddings capture all kinds of useful semantic relationships. For example, one cool emergent property is $ \\phi(king) - \\phi(queen) = \\phi(man) - \\phi(woman)$. To learn more about the magic behind word embeddings we recommend Chris Colahs \"[blog post](https://colah.github.io/posts/2014-07-NLP-RNNs-Representations/)\". A common tool for generating Word Embeddings is word2vec, which is what we'll be using today."

    "A classifier requires the input feature vector to be of fixed size, while sentences are of different lengths. Thus, we need a model (called as **encoder**) to transform a sentence to a fixed size vector. This could be done by a recurrent neural net (RNN), by taking the last hidden state of LSTM encoder as the feature vector. We could then build a linear (or a multi-layer) network upon it to perform a classifier.\n",
